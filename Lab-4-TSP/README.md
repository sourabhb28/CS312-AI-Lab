### BEFORE EXECUTION OF PROGRAM, NOTICE:

* After extracting these files, open bash in the same directory folder that these files are in
* This program was created in python3, hence the bash shell file is coded as such.
* Type into bash terminal: ```bash run.sh <file-name>``` , where ```<file-name>``` is the name of the input file, e.g. euc_100


* The program is set to stop after 250 seconds from the start OR after 600 iterations of ACO.
* The output will be displayed in the bash terminal itself.
* Preferably, wait until the execution is complete, i.e. 250s or 600 iterations.
* However, in case the value of cost has seemingly stabilized at some value for an extended num of runs, it is okay to consider it.
